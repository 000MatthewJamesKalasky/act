## How to contribute to ACT

(with thanks to the [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) guide from which this borrows heavily)

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/asyncvlsi/act/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/asyncvlsi/act/issues/new). 
   * Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and **an example** ACT file along with what you expect and the erroneous behavior.
   * For examples of good small test cases, please take a look at the test suite in the act/test/ directories.
   * Note that we would like to add your test case to this suite once the issue has been resolved, so please provide a test case where that will be possible and doesn't reveal anything confidential/etc.
   * Then, please don't get your hopes up! We will get to it as soon as possible but, unless the issue is a critical one, it is likely to take some time for resolution.  

### **Are you requesting a feature?**

* Please don't use Github issues as a way to request a feature.

* We have a [Mattermost site](http://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php) where you can self signup, and that is the most appropriate venue for feature requests.

* Note that the current feature set in the ACT core language has evolved through long experience, so be prepared for a robust discussion before any feature makes it to the TODO list for ACT.

* Once your feature request goes through the discussion phase, please don't be discouraged if your feature isn't immediately prioritized for implementation.


### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
   * Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
   * Please include at least a few small test cases (see above) that exercise your code and demonstrate that the bug has been fixed.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability or functionality of ACT will generally not be accepted (the Ruby on Rails guide has a [nice explanation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700) as to why this is the case).

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change on our [Mattermost site](http://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php) on the feature request channel and start writing code. Indicate that you plan to develop the feature.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question on the [Mattermost site](http://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php) on the developer channel.

### **Do you want to contribute to the ACT documentation?**

* Please take a look at the [existing documentation](http://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php), and identify the section you would like to contribute to.
* All the documentation uses [dokuwiki](http://dokuwiki.org), so please familiarize yourself with the syntax used.
* Then, please start a discussion on the [Mattermost site](http://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php) on the developer channel.

ACT is a volunteer effort. We would love your help!

Thanks!
